Buffered streams improve I/O performance by reducing the number of direct disk access operations.
Java provides BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream to wrap unbuffered streams.
This file is used to test performance differences between buffered and unbuffered streams.

Learning Java I/O streams is important for interviews and real-world applications.
FileInputStream reads data byte by byte directly from disk.
BufferedInputStream reads data in chunks and stores it in memory buffer.
