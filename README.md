# BridgeLabz Java Training Progress Log

This document tracks my daily learning progress during the BridgeLabz Java training program.

## 🗓️Day 1 – Git & GitHub Setup  
Date: 16-Dec-2025

- Installed and configured Git on the system.
- Created and linked the GitHub repository.
- Learned and practiced basic Git commands such as `git init`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
- Created the initial project structure for Core Java practice.
- Successfully pushed the initial setup to the remote repository.
