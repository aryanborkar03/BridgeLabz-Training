```
- Studied Lambda Expressions introduced in Java 8.
- Understood functional programming concepts in Java.
- Learned syntax of lambda expressions.
- Studied Functional Interfaces:
  - Concept of single abstract method (SAM).
  - Built-in functional interfaces: Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier.
- Used lambda expressions with functional interfaces.
- Practiced lambda usage with:
  - Runnable
  - Comparator
  - Collections (sorting, iteration)
- Reduced boilerplate code compared to anonymous classes.
- Understood use cases in streams and event handling.
- Practiced simple real-time examples.
- All work committed and pushed.

### 🗓 Day 2 – Stream API & Collectors  
**Date: 28-Jan-2026**

- Studied Java Stream API introduced in Java 8.
- Understood difference between collections and streams.
- Learned stream creation from:
  - Collections
  - Arrays
- Practiced intermediate operations:
  - filter
  - map
  - flatMap
  - sorted
- Practiced terminal operations:
  - forEach
  - collect
  - reduce
  - count
- Studied Collectors utility class:
  - toList
  - toSet
  - toMap
  - groupingBy
  - partitioningBy
  - joining
- Performed aggregation operations (sum, average, max, min).
- Implemented a mini-project named smart city management system using streams and collectors
- Practiced real-time examples on data processing.
- Improved code readability and functional-style programming.
- All work committed and pushed.
