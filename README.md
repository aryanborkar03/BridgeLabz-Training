# BridgeLabz-Training

---

This repository documents my learning progress during the BridgeLabz Java training program. The training focused on building strong fundamentals in Git, GitHub, and Core Java through daily practice, structured problem solving, and regular code commits. Each section reflects the concepts learned and the hands-on programs implemented during the training period.
