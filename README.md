# BridgeLabz Java Training Progress Log

This document tracks my daily learning progress during the BridgeLabz Java training program.

## Day 1 – Git & GitHub Setup  
Date: 16-Dec-2025

- Installed and configured Git on the system.
- Created and linked the GitHub repository.
- Learned and practiced basic Git commands such as `git init`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
- Created the initial project structure for Core Java practice.
- Successfully pushed the initial setup to the remote repository.

## Day 2 – Git Practice & Basic Java Programs  
Date: 17-Dec-2025

- Practiced Git workflow to understand version control and commits.
- Worked on very basic Java programs to understand syntax and program structure.
- Practiced adding, committing, and pushing Java files using `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
- Gained hands-on experience by updating the repository regularly.

## Day 3 – Programming Elements in Java  
Date: 18-Dec-2025

- Studied core Java programming elements including variables and data types.
- Learned and practiced different types of operators.
- Worked with user input and output using standard input methods.
- Solved practice problems based on programming elements.
- Committed and pushed solutions to the GitHub repository.

## Day 4 – Control Flow & Logical Constructs  
Date: 19-Dec-2025

- Studied control flow statements including `if`, `if-else`, and `switch`.
- Practiced the use of the ternary operator.
- Learned iteration statements: `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- Used `break` and `continue` statements in loop-based programs.
- Solved logical problems such as factorial calculation and prime number check.
- Committed and pushed control flow related programs to the repository.

## Day 5 – Arrays & Basic Problem Solving  
Date: 20-Dec-2025

- Studied single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays in Java.
- Practiced array declaration, initialization, and traversal.
- Implemented array-based logic and operations.
- Solved basic array problems such as finding missing elements.
- Improved logical thinking through hands-on array problem solving.
- Committed and pushed array-related programs to the repository.
